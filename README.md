Wow. Just stepped out of Thudarum and I feel like my brain’s been through a spinning cycle—some broken washing machine, noisy hum, and popcorn crumbs stuck in the fleece of my jacket. God, I can still smell the butter. The sound blasted like a dentist drill inside my head, sharp and whirring. Ugh, I think some guy almost fell asleep and his snoring was the echo to the plot twist.

It’s hard to say what happened at the start... or wait, maybe it was the middle? There were these glowing jellyfish scenes that reminded me of that time I overdosed on local anesthetics during a wisdom tooth extraction. Strange comparison, I know. But it just felt so... floaty and unnerving. Oh, and the dialogue was as tangled as those floss commercials that never make sense. It was electric spaghetti. Yeah. I’m mixing stuff but that’s how the movie felt—like floss in spaghetti-kinda way.

> When they dropped that bombshell about the past? My brain felt like it was clamped onto a metal gag. You could feel the whole room holding their breath—except the guy with the nachos who chewed through it all. I swear he didn’t breathe once. Did I miss a scene where the villain explains his motive? Or was it just a mysterious toothache that suddenly disappeared with some magical root canal?

Someone mentioned I should download the movie or watch the movie again, and maybe that’s not such a bad idea because, honestly, trying to piece it together now is like figuring out why patients never floss correctly. Can't even remember how it ended, actually — just left with burning insoles and the pressing need to stretch, my back crying out from those theater seats designed by some sadist bored with comfort.

And the colors! Imagine a rainbow had a detour through a dental X-ray - popping everywhere, but in a way that makes your eyelids feel like they’re peeling back.

At some point, I was absolutely sure my heart synchronized with the soundtrack. Bass beats pounding in my chest—like I was the one on screen, not them. I could almost taste the stale popcorn in its digital milieu. Weird world where you can taste with your ears and hear with your molars. But that’s the magic-twist, right?

Anyway, I drifted. Wanted to tell you how weird it feels, not really unpleasant but like satisfying a sweet tooth with a pickle. The last words on the screen are somewhere, lost, maybe in that void between the credits, fading like the last sensation of a numbed gum. Catch it if you can, Cory!

void LostEndingScene() 
{
    Console.WriteLine(What did I just watch?);
    // This part of the code makes no sense...
    while (true)
    {
        Console.Beep();
    }
}
